Project 3 is a final assignment from an object-oriented programming class. The goal of this project was to employ the use of Java classes and class hierarchy.
This program allows the user to create a database of any person in a college. The person can be distinguished between a student and an employee.
An employee can be further distinguished by either a staff or faculty member.

Expected inputs are menu selections, and data about a person (name, ID, department, GPA, etc.)

Expected outputs are information regarding all persons in the database. Once the user exits the program they are asked if they would like a report generated.
Output for the "report" is a .txt file containing lists of all persons and associated information separated into their appropriate classes.
